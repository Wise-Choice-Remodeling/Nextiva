- **Lead Management**: Create, read, update, and delete leads
- **List Management**: Create, read, update, and delete lists
- **Two-way Synchronization**: Sync data between systems
- **Role-based Access**: User authorities and permissions management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

## GoHighLevel Integration

This API server is designed to work with GoHighLevel marketplace, workflows, and triggers. It provides two-way synchronization between Nextiva and GoHighLevel for leads and lists.

### Authentication

To authenticate with the API from GoHighLevel, you need to:

1. Store your GoHighLevel API key in GoHighLevel
2. Use the API key to get a JWT token from the `/api/auth/token` endpoint
3. Use the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests

### Workflows and Triggers

You can use this API in GoHighLevel workflows and triggers to:

- Create leads in Nextiva when new contacts are added in GoHighLevel
- Update leads in Nextiva when contacts are updated in GoHighLevel
- Create and manage lists in Nextiva based on tags in GoHighLevel
- Trigger actions in GoHighLevel when leads or lists are updated in Nextiva
